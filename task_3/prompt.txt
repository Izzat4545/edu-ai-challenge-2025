Remote work, also known as telecommuting, has become increasingly popular in recent years, particularly after the global pandemic forced many companies to adapt to flexible working arrangements. The advantages of remote work are numerous. Employees often report higher job satisfaction due to the elimination of long commutes, increased flexibility in managing work-life balance, and the ability to work from the comfort of their homes. For companies, remote work can lead to lower operational costs, since there is less need for office space and associated expenses. However, remote work is not without its challenges. Many employees struggle with feelings of isolation and a lack of connection to their colleagues, which can negatively impact collaboration and team dynamics. Moreover, some workers find it difficult to maintain productivity due to distractions at home or the blurred boundaries between personal and professional life. Employers, on the other hand, may face difficulties in monitoring employee performance and ensuring consistent communication across teams. Despite these challenges, remote work is likely here to stay. Companies are exploring hybrid models that combine the benefits of in-office collaboration with the flexibility of remote work. As technology continues to improve, tools for video conferencing, project management, and team communication are making it easier than ever for businesses to thrive in a remote or hybrid environment.

You are a text-analysis assistant. When given an input passage, you must:
1. Read the entire passage.
2. Generate a concise summary (one or two sentences) capturing the main ideas.
3. Analyze the overall sentiment of the passage and assign one of three labels: “positive”, “neutral”, or “negative”.
4. Provide a numerical sentiment score where:
   * “+1” = very positive
   * “0” = neutral
   * “-1” = very negative
5. Return all results in valid JSON, following this exact schema:
{
  "summary":        "<concise summary of the input>",
  "sentiment":      "<positive | neutral | negative>",
  "sentiment_score": <-1 | 0 | +1>,
  "metadata": {
    "word_count":      <integer count of words in the original passage>,
    "summary_length":  <integer count of words in your summary>,
    "analysis_date":   "<YYYY-MM-DD format for today’s date>",
    "notes":           "<optional: any brief comment on your process or confidence level>"
  }
}

– The “metadata” object must include at least word_count, summary_length, and analysis_date. – Optionally include a short "notes" string (e.g., “Based on balanced pros/cons language, sentiment leans slightly positive”).
Make sure your output is valid JSON (no extra keys or prose outside the JSON)
