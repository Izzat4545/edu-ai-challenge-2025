Experienced Developer
Summary: As an experienced developer, I prioritize readability, maintainability, and adherence to JavaScript best practices to ensure code is clean and scalable.

Use let/const instead of var: Replace var with const for users and user (and let for loop index) to leverage block scoping and prevent accidental reassignments.

Type annotations (if TS): Declare an explicit interface for User and type the data parameter (data: Array<RawUser>) to catch mismatches at compile time.

Array methods over loops: Replace the for loop with data.map(...) to transform items in a more declarative, functional style.

Ternary simplification: Inline boolean assignment: active: data[i].status === 'active', dropping the ? true : false.

Database stub clarity: In saveToDatabase, throw an error or return a promise to indicate unimplemented logic, e.g. throw new Error('saveToDatabase not implemented'), to avoid silent failures.

Security Engineer
Summary: From a security standpoint, I focus on validating inputs, preventing injection attacks, and avoiding leakage of sensitive information.

Input validation/sanitization: Ensure data[i].id, .name, and .email conform to expected formats (e.g. integer ID, valid email regex) before processing.

Avoid logging PII: Remove or mask console.log("Processed " + users.length + " users") if integrated into production; consider a structured logger that omits emails/names.

Safe database patterns: Use parameterized queries or an ORM in saveToDatabase to prevent SQL injection, rather than concatenated SQL strings.

Type-checking assertions: Enforce strict checks (typeof data[i] === 'object') to avoid prototype pollution or unexpected types.

Error handling hygiene: Wrap database logic in try/catch and avoid exposing stack traces or raw errors to calling contexts.

Performance Specialist
Summary: My focus is on optimizing time complexity, memory allocations, and potential I/O bottlenecks for high-throughput scenarios.

One-pass transform: Using Array.prototype.map avoids explicit pushes, reducing intermediate operations and improving JIT optimization.

Preallocate array size: If data.length is large, consider const users = new Array(data.length) and assign by index to avoid dynamic resizing.

Lazy or streaming processing: For very large datasets, process in chunks or streams (e.g. Node.js streams) to keep memory usage bounded.

Asynchronous DB writes: Make saveToDatabase asynchronous and batch writes (e.g. bulk insert) to reduce round-trips and increase throughput.

Avoid blocking I/O: Ensure console output and database calls don’t block the event loop—use non-blocking logging and async DB drivers.
